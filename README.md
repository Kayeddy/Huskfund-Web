# huskfund

A Web3 crowdfunding platform.

- Started off with the creation of the Web3 project using the 'npx thirdweb@latest create --contract' command inside the root folder. Also created a client folder inside the root folder.

- Started off the code with the contract.sol creation.

- Then modified our hardhat configuration, adding the following:

...
defaultNetwork: "goerli",
networks: {
hardhat: {},
goerli: {
url: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli",
accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_METAMASK_KEY}`],
},

Where the endpoint used for the goerli url was obtained from the website the url directs to.

- We ran the project using the 'npm run deploy' command inside the folder that we created using thirdweb. Running this scripts automatically creates our artifacts and uploads the contracts data to their servers.

- After the previous step we followed the link generated by the deployment of the build, and then connected our MetaMask wallet to the website.

- After we follow the steps on the Thirdweb website our contract will be deployed and we can then use the paces on the code tab to connnect our application to our deployed smart contracts.

- We then head back into our clien's folder and start the connection mentioned above by installing the thirdweb cli in our frontend, using the following command: 'npx thirdweb create --app'
